          <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
          <p>
            Everything we do is rooted in sport. Sport plays an increasingly
            important role in more and more people’s lives, on and off the field
            of play. It is central to every culture and society and is core to
            our health and happiness. Key to our success and the execution of
            our strategy ‘Own the Game’, are our people and our culture. They
            bring our identity to life, defined by our purpose, mission, and
            attitude.
            <br /><br />
            Our purpose, ‘through sport, we have the power to change lives’,
            guides the way we run our company, how we work with our partners,
            how we create our products, and how we engage with our consumers. We
            will always strive to expand the limits of human possibilities, to
            include and unite people in sport, and to create a more sustainable
            world.
            <br /><br />
            Athletes do not settle for average. And neither do we. We have a
            clear mission: To be the best sports brand in the world. Every day,
            we come to work to create and sell the best sports products in the
            world, and to offer the best service and consumer experience – and
            to do it all in a sustainable way. We are the best when we are the
            credible, inclusive, and sustainable leader in our industry.
            <br /><br />
            At Vendraw, we are rebellious optimists driven by action, with a
            desire to shape a better future together. We see the world of sport
            and culture with possibility where others only see the impossible.
            ‘Impossible is Nothing’ is not a tagline for us. By being optimistic
            and knowing the power of sport, we see endless possibilities to
            apply this power and push all people forward with action.
